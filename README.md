bla bla asdfghjkl


BEcause of compability reasons I couldnt start JUnit tests
in the Eclipse Projectt form Matthias. I used a workaround.
Now I cannot upload the complete proejct as whole. (NettBeans kanns nicht)
So I pushed the normal eclipse project with my changes and the single
JUnit test file is in a seperate folder.
